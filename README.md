👋 Hi, I am Hangjie Yuan (**袁杭杰** in Chinese). 
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate from Zhejiang University supervised by Prof. [Dong Ni](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/nidong), and a long-term research intern at Alibaba DAMO Academy. I am undertaking a visiting Ph.D. program at [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), supervised by Prof. [Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/).
Additionally, I am supervised by Prof. [Samuel Albanie](https://samuelalbanie.com/) (the University of Cambridge) and Dr. [Shiwei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZO3OQ-8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (Alibaba DAMO Academy).

While conducting research, I prioritize humanity above all else. Therefore, the ultimate goal of my research is to **prioritize human well-being**.

Check out some of my cool projects: [InstructVideo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12490), [VideoComposer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02018), and the RLIP series ([RLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01814) & [RLIPv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09351)).
